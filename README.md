# PEP
P.ioneer E.MA P.rototype

Please see the [EMA README](https://github.com/SaplingStudios/EMA/blob/master/README.md) for how to compile this project.

### Project Description:

PEP is designed to be a peppy little example/proof of concept for EMA.  Additionally, since PEP is the very first project being made with EMA, it will naturally challenge EMA's capabilities and allow me to expand EMA into what I see it to be in my mind.

PEP will take place on a medium-small island that will have one or two species each of plants and animals. These organisms will not be the only thing that is alive however, since they depend on the world around them for nourishment; the sun will heat the earth, which will keep the air around the organisms warm: rich veins of water will run underground, providing the plants with the nutrients they need through their roots: and even air will move as it should, spreading the pollen and seeds of the plants around, helping them reproduce.
